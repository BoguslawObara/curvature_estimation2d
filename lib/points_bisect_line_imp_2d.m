%% POINTS_BISECT_LINE_IMP_2D: implicit bisector line between two points in 2D.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    This routine finds, in implicit form, the equation of the line
%    that is equidistant from two points.
%
%    The implicit form of a line in 2D is:
%
%      A * X + B * Y + C = 0

%  Parameters:
%
%    Input, real P1(2), P2(2), the coordinates of two points.
%
%    Output, real A, B, C, the parameters of the implicit line
%    equidistant from both points.
