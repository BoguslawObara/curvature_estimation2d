%
%  Parameters:
%
%    Input, integer N, the order of the matrix.
%
%    Input, integer NRHS, the number of right hand sides.  NRHS
%    must be at least 0.
%
%    Input, real A(N,N+NRHS), contains in rows and
%    columns 1 to N the coefficient matrix, and in columns N+1 through
%    N+NRHS, the right hand sides.
%
%    Output, real A(N,N+NRHS), the coefficient matrix
%    area has been destroyed, while the right hand sides have
%    been overwritten with the corresponding solutions.
%
%    Output, integer INFO, singularity flag.
%    0, the matrix was not singular, the solutions were computed;
%    J, factorization failed on step J, and the solutions could not
%    be computed.

%
%  Choose a pivot row IPIVOT.

%
%  Interchange.

%  A(J,J) becomes 1.
%

    a(j,j+1:n+nrhs) = a(j,j+1:n+nrhs) / apivot;

%  A(I,J) becomes 0.
